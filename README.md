Name of MAWT_Method

Published in: MAWTROLL

Description: 'The main code for the simulation section. In this part, we simulate four data
generate processing,replicating 200 times. We use MAWT algorithm to calculate the solution of
discrete bi-objective problems,that is, MSE and heterogeneity.'

Keywords: 'simulation, MAWT algorithm, MSE (mean square error), Euclidean distance'
