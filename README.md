# ROLLMAWT
README:
Two file folders are simulation code and empirical code/data: ROLLMAWT_Simulation (simulation code) and ROLLMAWT-TailNetwork (empirical code and data) 

Published in: MAWTROLL

Description: 
   1. 'In the file folder 'ROLLMAWT_Simulation', the 'MAWT method.R' is the main code.We simulate four data
generate processing,replicating 200 times. We use MAWT algorithm to calculate the solution of
discrete bi-objective problems,that is, MSE and heterogeneity.'
   2. 'In the file folder 'ROLLMAWT-TailNetwork', the 'MAWT_MainCode.R' is the main code for empirical code. 
'Figure.R' is to plot all figures in our empirical part, that is, network analysis. '

Keywords: 'Simulation, MAWT algorithm, High-dimensional quantile regression, lasso, tail risk, network analysis'
